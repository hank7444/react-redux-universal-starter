/*
It's important to only prepend it with ~, 
because ~/ resolves to the home-directory. 
webpack needs to distinguish between bootstrap and ~bootstrap
because CSS- and Sass-files have no special syntax for 
importing relative files. Writing @import "file" is the same as @import "./file";
*/

// 這樣可以引入css, 不過計算很慢, 裡面其他相對路徑的檔案全都會找不到，不建議
//@import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap";

@import "./global.scss";
@import "./global2.scss";
//@import "./global3.scss";
// fuxk! css還是不會照順序, 還是要轉成scss, 不然就要在Html.js裡面用link 引入
//@import "../css/test.css";
